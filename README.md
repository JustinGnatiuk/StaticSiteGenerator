## Static Site Generator built by Justin Gnatiuk

This is a static site generator built in python.

It is currently utilized to host off a github page built from this repo.

To replicate locally, you can just run an http server from the "docs" folder of the cloned directory

## Directions for use
1. clone repo
2. build your static site markdown directory tree in "content" folder
3. place any image and css resources in "static" folder. 
4. run build.sh to build html pages inside of docs folder.

* the docs folder was chosen because github hosts public sites from the "docs" directory of the repo. If you want to test your site locally you can start a webserver with the "docs" folder as the base directory.
